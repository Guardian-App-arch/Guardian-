                        The Guardian project began with a simple yet powerful idea: to use artificial intelligence to make our communities
                        safer. As a team of university students, we're proud to announce the successful development of our AI-powered safety
                        tool. This innovative system actively monitors ambient audio, identifies potential dangers, and immediately sends
                        critical alerts to those who can help - from police and hospitals to family members. Guardian is our contribution to a
                        more secure future, putting intelligent assistance directly where it's needed most.

                            The project is an AI-powered tool called <strong>Guardian</strong> designed to detect dangerous situations and instantly alert
                            relevant parties such as police, hospitals, or family members. By continuously analyzing ambient audio, Guardian
                            identifies threats and ensures timely notification, improving response to dangerous situations.
                            Guardian utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive front-end, with PHP handling back-end
                            operations. Audio transcription is powered by the Whisper (base.en) AI model, while Ollama running Phi3.5 analyzes the
                            transcribed text for signs of danger. In the event of a threat, Twilio is used to dispatch immediate SMS alerts.
